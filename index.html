        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="bio-container">
          <p>I am an aspiring creative engineer with a passion for blending technology, art, and sustainable solutions. I thrive in environments that allow me to solve problems creatively while contributing to environmental preservation and sustainability.</p>

          <p>I am currently studying Computer Engineering with a minor in German Studies at Union College.</p>

          <p>One of my favorite projects involved researching and designing U.S. governmental policies to support vehicle electrification, combining technology, sustainability, and actionable change. I’ve also developed digital signal processing simulations and created interactive web designs. At Union College, I am an active member of the Ozone House, where I collaborate on sustainability initiatives to promote environmental awareness on campus.</p>

          <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy gardening, experimenting with fiber arts, and exploring hiking trails. I am not sure what my future holds, but I hope to combine my love of technology, creativity, and sustainability to help build a more sustainable future.</p>

                <summary>Click to read about my unexpected journey as a florist!       </summary>
                <p>During my time off from college last year, I worked at my town's local florist, Ambler Flower Shop. What started as a job during my gap year quickly became an experience I’ll never forget. I helped the owner manage the shop, ran floral workshops, boosted sales through better marketing and social media, and collaborated with other businesses in the area. I even joined the county's tourism board to promote local events and helped lead my town's annual carnival and Christmas parade. I loved every moment of it, from designing bouquets to connecting with the community!</p>
            </details>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Sometimes the best opportunities come when you least expect them."
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>What This Experience Taught Me:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of community and collaboration in running a business.</li>
                <li>How to combine creativity and business management for success.</li>
                <li>There are opportunities to combine my knowledge in technology to seemingly unrealtted fields like floristry.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>What’s even more surprising is that my boss, who is now looking to retire, has offered me the opportunity to take over the flower shop after I graduate. Running a flower shop would be an incredible and rewarding path, though it’s a world away from my journey as an engineer. Who knows, maybe I’ll find a way to combine my love for floristry with technology and sustainability!</p>
